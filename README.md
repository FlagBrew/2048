# 2048

2048 port for Switch Homebrew. 

I ported this game to the Switch in 2018 before even owning a console to test it on. It has been a really fun experience.

## Instructions

Open the game on the homebrew launcher and play. You can start a new game by pressing B.

Your current gamestate will be saved when you quit the game using **+** and will be loaded the next time you want to play.
